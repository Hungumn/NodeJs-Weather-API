Weather Company Data API access using NodeJs

This project shows how to build a basic data access application that continuously runs in the background, processing a variety of weather data from the Weather Company Data for IBM REST API endpoints, including severe weather alerts, tropical storm forecasts, and the daily weather almanac to find conditions over time.
